# Capstone Project: Booger Library

## Project Idea

The idea of my capstone project is simple: I am going to develop a frontend website with simple navigation, featuring two major components: an authentication page and a home page. The home page will be a search page to list, add, and delete book and issue data for the user.

## Two-Day Plan

### Tuesday: Project Setup & Initial Development
- Set up the project repository on GitHub and make the initial commit.
- Prepare the frontend using React (or HTML/CSS if needed).
- Deploy the first working version of the frontend (even if minimal).
- Continue learning and applying frontend development best practices.

### Wednesday: Component Development & Finalization
- Develop the main components:
  - Authentication page (login/signup UI)
  - Home page with search, list, add, update, and delete functionality for books and issues.
- Refine the UI to match the intended design and user experience.
- Ensure all components are styled and functional.
- Test all CRUD operations for reliability.
- Prepare the app for final review and submission.
